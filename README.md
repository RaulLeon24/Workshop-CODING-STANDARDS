Course: Software Engineer P 102

I had problems with the user of the git in the computer lab so I commitin Github two files one with the base code and the other contains the correct code with the requirements.

---

The test.py file is the base code with errors that have not been tested or fixed.

---
The main.py file has been corrected and the requirements requested in the workshop have been added.
